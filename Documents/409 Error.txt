My website, stjamesmcconnelsville.org, is hosted on bluehost.  It has an add-on domain, wornoutoldman.com, which I am working on.  I am using a form on a webpage to send an e-mail.  There is js code on the webpage that does a POST to a php file on the host.

I am running into a problem that the e-mail form will work fine for a while and then I will start getting a 409 HTTP error every time I try to send an e-mail.  When I use Chrome to debug the js code and I look at the network communications, the message that I am sending looks the same every time.

When the e-mail works I receive the expected response from the php file of ‘OK’.  When I get the 409 HTTP error, I receive the following response:

<script>
    document.cookie = "humans_21909=1";
    document.location.reload(true)
</script>

I have even deleted the php file from the server and I still get this response.

Some online search results claim that this can be a problem with the ISP seeing my e-mail as a security issue or an IP address being blacklisted.
